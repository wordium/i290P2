Project title: Movie Genre Guesser

Project description: The user is given posters from two sets of three movies, with information about the movies taken from Rotten Tomaties. For each, they are asked to guess the genre of each. The first three are freeform, with no suggestions. The second set provides a drop-down list of suggestions, taken from Rotten Tomatoes. We hope to show that people are lazy, and that schemas aren't neutral: in the second set we expect that people will choose an autocomplete option (laziness) which is different from what they would have said (schemas aren't neutral). For example, choosing "Action & Adventure" instead of "action" for the second set.
